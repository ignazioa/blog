Good structured data: 
* [Worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/): overall, up-to-date, figure;
* [Our world in data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-testing): testing distributition worldwide;

Most engineeres are now working from home and having more time in their hands and quite a bit of them decided to help.

Good projects I found:    
* [Help with COVID](https://helpwithcovid.com/): Recruiting Projects and Engineers to help (volounteers);
* [The tap room](https://twitter.com/kvlly/status/1241036548243685377): free support for small business to setup Shopify;
